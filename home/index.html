    Hi! My name is Junhyoung Chung. 
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 2.0; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Statistics at Seoul National University under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gwpark">Gunwoong Park</a>.
    Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Statistics and Economics from Seoul National University.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 2.0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    My academic goal is to design statistical learning algorithms that address practical challenges while maintaining statistical efficiency, with a few sub-objectives:
  </p>

  <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 2.2; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <li>Developing robust models for noisy data.</li>
    <li>Devising novel methodologies that learn complex data.</li>
    <li>Ensuring computational scalability for large datasets.</li>
    <li>Providing statistical guidance to assess and guarantee the reliability of machine-learned systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="line-height: 2.0;">
    Recently, my research has centered on probabilistic graphical models, especially on developing consistent structure learning algorithms that account for measurement error. 
    I have also carried out applied research introducing statistical algorithms tailored to real-world problem solving.
